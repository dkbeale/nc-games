# Front-End React Games App!

## [Hosted Front-End App](https://board-of-reviews.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary

Welcome to my React based front-end web app! I have created this to practice my skills and to use as an example of my work. In this repository you will find a working web-app written using a combination of Node.js, HTML and CSS, with the use of React, React Router, and a combination of CSS and the Bulma framework for styling.

While you can see the app in action by visiting the link above, I have also provided instructions below so that you could copy this repo and open it yourself.

## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version 16.5.0 or above (earlier versions may work but I cannot guarantee this)

## Setting up the project

1) To start with you will need to clone the repo to your local machine. Click on the green code button above the files index on this page, and copy the link provided. Next use your terminal to enter the directory you would like to clone the repo in and enter this command:

```
$ git clone (paste repo URL here)
```
After running this command, the terminal will ask you for your github username and password.

2) Next you will need to install dependencies using the following command inside the newly created directory:

```
$ npm i
```
3) Finally if you run the following command, again inside the main directory:

```
$ npm start
```

That should be everything you need to get going
